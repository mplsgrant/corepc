# Bitcoin Core JSON-RPC support

There are two primary purposes of this repository:

1. Provide the [`corepc-types`](https://crates.io/crates/corepc-types) crate for use in production
   software. 
   
2. Provide tools for integration testing Rust code that interacts with the Bitcoin network.
   Primarily consumers of the [`rust-bitcoin`](https://crates.io/crates/bitcoin) library. And enable
   doing so against multiple versions of Bitcoin Core.

If you require a JSON RPC client in production software it is expected you write your own and only
use the `corepc-types` crate in your dependency graph. Feel free to copy/steal/plagiarise or
otherwise enjoy yourself with anything in this repository - no attribution required.

**Please do not use `corepc` in production and raise bugs, issues, or feature requests.**

## Crate/directory listing

- `types/`: [`corepc-types`](https://crates.io/crates/corepc-types): Rust types returned by the JSON-RPC API of Bitcoin Core.
- `bitcoind/`: [`corepc-node`](https://crates.io/crates/corepc-node): Runs `bitcoind` regtest nodes.
- `client/`: [`corepc-client`](https://crates.io/crates/corepc-client): A blocking JSON-RPC client used to test `corepc-types`.
- `integration_test/`: Integration tests that use `corepc` and `corepc-node` to test `corepc-types`.


## `corepc-types` Design

## Original code

I don't know who is using `bitcoind` and/or `rust-bitocincore-rpc` in the wild and I do not want to
disrupt them. As such `bitcoind` was pulled in here with permission of the original author.

Some code shamelessly stolen from `rust-bitcoincore-rpc` (credit to Steven).

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This library should always compile with any combination of features on **Rust 1.63.0**.

Use `Cargo-minimal.lock` to build the MSRV by copying to `Cargo.lock` and building.
